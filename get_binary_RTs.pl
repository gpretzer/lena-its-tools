# When a sequence of 1 or more child (or adult) segments is produced with no more than 1 
# second intervening between the segments, find out if an adult (or child) segment 
# followed within 1 second or less.

# Take 4 command line arguments: 
# 1. The name of the combined AN and CHN input file
# 2. The name of the child response output file (the value will be 0 if a response was received within 1 s and 1.1 if a response was not received within 1 s)
# 3. The name of the adult response output file (the value will be 0 if a response was received within 1 s and 1.1 if a response was not received within 1 s)
# 4. Whether turns with overlap in between should be excluded or not (if yes, 'true'; if not, 'false')
# 5. The CHN Utt duration cutoff above which a child vocalization is said to consider speech-related material

# Instructions:
# 1. Open up a unix shell (e.g. the Terminal application under Utilities on Mac or Cygwin on Windows)
# 2. Navigate to the directory where this file is located (e.g. "~/Desktop/lena-its-tools/")
# 3. Run recorderpauses.pl with the path and file name of the combined AN and CHN input file as the first argument; the path and name file of the child response probability as the 2nd argument;
#    the path and file name of the adult response probability output file as the 3rd argument; whether turns with overlap in between should be excluded as the 4th argument;
#    and the CHN Utt duration cutoff above which a child vocalization is said to consider speech-related material as the 5th argument.
